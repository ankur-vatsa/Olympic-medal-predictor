# Olympic-medal-predictor
This is a naive project which i did to get the working process of Lineaer Regression. 
This model predicts the number of medals which will be won by a team in a year in olympic. 
This model works good with less error for the country which have large number of players.
But the error rate or the accuracy is low for the teams with lesser number of players.
